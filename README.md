Just what the name suggests, A light tiny framework built with php.

The point of this framework, is to not be a framework. More of a scaffolding type of thing. *Why you ask?* Well, I'm the kind of guy who hate spending hours and hours trying to learn a good framework, just to find out that it is just cumbersome to work with. So I usually just set up the minimum environment I need, *without any framework*, and I did the exact same thing when I accidentally created something that I taught was "pretty darn good", so why not package it as a framework to use the next time I don't need a framework..
